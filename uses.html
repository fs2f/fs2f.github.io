# Uses

My distro that I've been driving over the course of
the last month is Void Linux. It's small, doesn't get in my
way and has great repositories, in comparison to my experience
with Alpine (no hate towards it or its userbase, just personal
experience).

To quick-edit files, I use nvim and for more extensive editing,
I use VSCodium.

As my choice of web browser, I use Firefox because it's pretty light 
and extensible.

I constantly hop window managers, but the latest one I've used is ctwm,
despite it being so wildly archaic.
