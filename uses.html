    <h3 id="distro">Distribution</h3>
    <p>My current Linux distribution is Void Linux because I like its idea, minimalism and package manager.</p>
    <p>Plus, it doesn't use nearly as many resources as Debian did, which literally gave me free heating.</p>

    <h3 id="editor">Editor</h3>
    <p>I've been a devoted Vim user for a while before finally discovering Neovim. I've decided to switch mainly
        because of the speed upgrade and overall UX.</p>
    <p>My config is all pure Vimscript, no plugins and very small, even featuring a neat statusbar! I'll upload it
        whenever I upload my full dotfiles.</p>

    <h3 id="environment">Environment</h3>
    <p>Despite me preferring newer solutions over older ones, I still use X11! I've also taken a liking to half-obscure
        window managers. For example, for the last month I've been hopping from evilWM to CTWM, which are both surprisingly
        well-performing in 2024. EvilWM is still maintained, the last release being March this year (2024).

    <p>My terminal is usually just urxvt. Not much to be said here, simple and sweet. That's it.</p>
    <h3 id="website">Website</h3>
    <p>This page was made with pure HTML and CSS (with the exception of the <a href="/cat.html">cat page</a>.</p>
    <p>I now enjoy coding in JS and I consider it a very versatile tool, though I still stay away from frameworks,
        be it for JS or CSS.</p>
    <p>This page was edited through VSCode, graciously hosted online by GitHub. Here's the <a href="https://github.dev">link</a> if you want.</p>
