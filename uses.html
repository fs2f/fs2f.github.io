Software I use
=======================
I daily-drive Void Linux, because I like its concept and simplicity.
Not much to be said here.

I use Neovim for daily editing as it's hyper-extensible and I can't
really care to learn any other editor. It edits text, that's all I want.

Fun fact: I still haven't hopped over to Wayland! X11 is still my display
server and my window manager is CTWM. It's actually pretty nice, and I may
even write a small post on how to configure it at some point.

I also have a designated Ubuntu miniPC where I self-host various services like
Sonarr.
