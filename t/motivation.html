        <h3>no motivation.</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>it doesn't matter what you're doing, burnouts are inevitable. maybe you're coding, drawing, writing, whatever. any creative task is bound to make you tired and eventually run out of ideas.</p>
        <p>you can't avoid it, sadly. but you can helf yourself out of it. here's how i do it:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>relax. take a break, close your device and have a breath of fresh air.</li>
            <li>find inspiration from other works, and when you feel like it, mess around.</li>
            <li>when you're done messing around, you can start doing serious things again!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>this works out for me every. single. time, and it's bound to work for you, too. it's extremely simple and yet people somehow still don't understand it.</p>
        <p>tl;dr: being demotivated or burnt out is ok, take a break and start fresh.</p>
