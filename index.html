            <p>Hey there! I'm fs, a UNIX minimalist and ricer.</p>
            <p>Over here I may blog some stuff, talk about something I learned, and so on.</p>
            <p>Sorry that this is so empty. I'm not very creative.. but have some of my interests!</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ricing:</strong> Who doesn't? Tweaking your setup is always fun.</li>
                <li><strong>ANSI art:</strong> A really cool artform that uses only 16 colors and some box drawing characters.</li>
                <li><strong>Floral photography:</strong> I don't know, I just like flowers, and there's a lot around where I am.</li>
                <li><strong>Scripting:</strong> I'm learning Python, mostly out of boredom. I also know Bash, though not very well.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <p>And that was it for my pretty boring homepage.</p>
            <p>I'll add more links soon, don't worry. Peace!</p>
