   &gt; ^ &lt;          seo's website</pre>
        <p>you've reached the domain of seo! i like linux, cats and niche things. i reside in a small corner of the internet that isn't very populated, but it's cozy here.</p>
        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>i'm an aspiring developer and a silly guy, i mess with tech frequently and i have a lot of projects i wanna take on.</p>
        <p>i strongly enjoy minimalism, both in design and software. my music taste is, weird, to say the least. i like a lot of music genres, from shoegaze to extratone (heavily depends on what track it is though).</p>
        <p>i'm a guy (aroace, if that matters) and i live in the northern hemisphere. it's a very nice place, to be honest! somewhat chilly at times, but drinking some hot chocolate helps.</p>
        <p>i'm natively from russia, which means i speak russian somewhat fluently! however, english has become my main language of thought and communication ever since i moved.</p>
        <p>sometimes i volunteer as a sysadmin for some places. i only do it as a hobby though, since i can't fathom having to do this every day for years.</p>
        <h2>where i'm usually at</h2>
        <p>discord! my username is networkadapter, and i mostly reside in <a href="https://discord.gg/linux">All Things Linux</a>. you can find me there most of the time. usually, i just swing by every hour or so.</p>
