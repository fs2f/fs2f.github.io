    <p>Hi, I'm vnx. The breaker of things, ricer of desktops and petter of cats. This is my digital garden.</p>
    <p>A bit about me:<br>I really like coffee, troubleshooting, music (shoegaze and hyperpop, especially), kitties, dark mode and minimalism. I'm currently somewhere in the Northern Hemisphere of Planet Earth and I think it's very nice here.</p>
    <p>I like to keep it simple, which explains some of the approaches I take in my code, dotfiles, or anything similar. And no, I don't use a code formatter. The <code>Tab</code> key works just fine for me :)<br>Some software I use includes Void Linux, urxvt, i3, Neovim, VSCodium, Firefox and rofi. I don't think it matters too much, but if you're interested in that, then here you go!</p>
    <p>If you, for some reason, want to reach out to me, I can be found on tilde.chat under the nick <code>seo</code> or on email, at the address of <code>seo (at) atl (dot) tools</code>. I don't like social media too much, so I don't have things like Twitter or any of that kind.</p>
    <p>Have a nice one! ~vnx</p>
