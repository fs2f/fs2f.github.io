    <p>Welcome to my website. There isn't much to check out here, but it's a small internet garden of mine which I try to take care of.</p>
    <p>I'm interested in F(L)OSS, Linux, tech, flowers, photography, space and cats. I really like minimal design, whether it be backend or frontend. I'm currently floating somewhere around the Northern Hemisphere sipping my coffee.</p>
    <p>Currently the only viable option to contact me is via e-mail: <code><a href="mailto:seo@atl.tools">seo@atl.tools</a></code>. I don't check any other ones much, so you have more luck finding me here.<br>I still don't log onto it too often, so it may take up to a week for me to see your email. Sorry in advance.</p>
