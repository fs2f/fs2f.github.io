        <h2>XMPP in the modern age</h2>
        <p><a href="https://xmpp.org">XMPP</a>, also known as Jabber, is an instant messaging protocol created in 1999, intended to be small and extensible (which it succeeds at). XMPP is used in a lot of places, for instance Meta's WhatsApp, though a heavily modified version, and some AAA games' chat engines.<br>
        However, in comparison to other platforms like Discord or Slack, it still falls back, hence the userbase has become quite small since the time of release.<br>
        And I think that's complete bullshit.<br>
        Welcome to my guide on surviving on XMPP in the 21st century.
        </p>
        <h3 id="registering">Registering an account<a href="#registering">#</a></h3>
        <p>I'd assume you already have an XMPP account by now and have the credentials written down somewhere private. If not, head to xmpp.is (or the host of your choice) and register an account. It takes around 2 minutes, and by the end of the process, you will have an account ready for use.
        If, for some reason, you don't like xmpp.is, I recommend taking a look at the <a href="https://providers.xmpp.net/#providers">list of XMPP providers</a> that you can use.
        </p>
        <h3 id="clients">Picking a client<a href="#clients">#</a></h3>
        <p>XMPP has a lot of clients to offer, notably Gajim (cross-platform, GUI) and Profanity (cross-platform, CLI). This guide will only go over Gajim's setup since it's relatively easy and Gajim has a familiar interface to any *tox/chat platform released after 2010.<br>
        Head over to Gajim's homepage at <a href="https://gajim.org">gajim.org</a> and download the latest version. I'm unsure if Gajim is packaged on any Linux distributions or Winget, but it's in the Microsoft Store if you wish to download it that way.<br>
        After running Gajim, you're asked to enter your XMPP account credentials. Again, I hope you wrote those down because if not, you'll need to find them, one way or another.<br>
        Gajim has an interface similar to Slack or Discord's, with the chat and chatroom list being on the left, the chatting window in the center and member list on the right. I don't think I need to explain this one any further, it's very sightreadable and is easily navigable.<br>
        </p>
        <h3 id="communities">Finding communities<a href="#communities">#</a></h3>
        If you know the hostname of your XMPP chatroom, you can open the workspace you want, click on the "Start Chat" button and write the hostname. If you don't, you can search for communities/users in the same searchbar.
        <h3 id="thoughts">Closing thoughts<a href="#thoughts">#</a></h3>
        For its age, XMPP still holds up exceptionally well for this age's standards, and I was surprised to find so many communities related to my interests on there. Jabber will forever be a core part of instant messaging's history and a good example of how to make user-friendly software.
