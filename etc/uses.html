        <i>software that I use</i>
        <p>obviously inspired by other /uses pages. felt like making one incase someone cares ;)</p>
        <p>I daily-drive a linux distribution called <a href="https://voidlinux.org">void linux</a>. it's small, simple and doesn't fall apart.</p>
        <p>my display manager is x11, and I commonly switch between lesser known window managers. my current one is evilwm.</p>
        <p>I use nvim to edit text files. I don't have any plugins installed and will probably share my config at some point.
            I also don't have any lua code in my config! just pure vimscript.</p>
        <p>my irc client is rirc. tiny, yet powerful sums it up just right.</p>
        <p>the default browser that I use is firefox, because it doesn't nag you about stuff you frankly never need. it's also really small.</p>
