        <i>services and companies I avoid</i>
        <ul>
            <li>meta (facebook, instagram, etc): typical spyware. untrusted and had a number of dataleaks. also sells user data without consent.</li>
            <li>google (youtube, gmail, etc): same as above. sells data openly, embeds spyware into new devices.</li>
            <li>microsoft (outlook, bing, etc): again, same as above. except this time it also embeds AI onto your device to spy on your activity.
                yet I'm unwillingly supposed to use this.</li>
            <li>apple llc: bad software practices, data breaches, and of course, spyware.</li>
            <p>I won't go on to list <i>every</i> single company that does this, but FYI: most big corporations are not to be very trusted with your data.</p>
        </ul>
