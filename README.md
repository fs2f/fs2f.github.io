...with a bouncy cat!

## Why?

Because why not? Every site should feature a cat bouncing, rotating, or whatever you wish!
Cats are a staple of webdesign.

## How?

JavaScript glue and some free time. I really enjoyed messing with the animations, but they made me a bit motion sick..
Oh, and also: don't stare at this for too long. I don't recommend it, at all.
