    <h2>The lemon bar</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>I've been a devoted X11 user for as long as I can remember, and I usually have a bar sitting at the top of my screen.</p>
    <p>For the 2 months that I've used spectrwm, that bar was provided by the window manager itself, but now that I'm on cwm, I need to find a bar myself.</p>
    <p>And that bar is none other than Lemonbar by LemonBoy!</p>
    <p>Lemonbar is a simple x11 bar that just draws a window somewhere on the screen and exits. Simple enough.</p>
    <p>Now here's the interesting part: it doesn't have any sort of config. At all. No modules, no presets, nothing. Instead, you feed it text from stdin.
        That can be done by echoing the text into the bar itself manually or through a shell script.</p>
    <p>I've thrown together an example which you can see here:</p>
    <pre>
#!/usr/bin/env bash

while true; do
        echo "Hi! The date is $(date +'%I:%M %p')"
        sleep 0.2
done</pre>
    <p>The following script can be piped into Lemonbar right now or further tweaked.</p>
    <h3>Customization</h3>
    <p>For now, I recommend getting the xft fonts fork of lemonbar from <a href="https://github.com/drscream/lemonbar-xft">here</a>.</p>
    <p>All customization is done through flags given at bar startup. The full list can be found on the manpage, but here's a couple:</p>
    <pre>
-g: changes bar geometry
-B: changes background color
-F: changes foreground color
-u,-U: changes underline width and color, respectively
-F: changes default font</pre>
    <p>Those alone should be enough to get you up and going. For more stuff you can do with it, check out Sacules' guide on it <a href="https://sacules.github.io/post/how-to-lemonbar">here</a>.</p>
    <p>Happy tweaking!</p>
