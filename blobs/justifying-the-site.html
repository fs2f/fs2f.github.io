    <h2>Justifying the site</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>First of all, hi! Welcome to my first blob. This is a pretty experimental thing I'm trying to test the waters, so don't judge too harshly.</p>
    <p>To the point: this site has had many revisions, among which there were more heavy and animated versions and small, minimal and/or text-based ones.</p>
    <p>This one was made with readability and coziness in mind, and also just because I miss the old internet! The one where your computer didn't need to waste
        4 seconds on loading a webfont that only serves the purpose of adding a welcome message, the one where you didn't have to go and prepend 12ft.io/ to every URL,
        the one where everything was within reach. Plain and simple, that's all.</p>
    <p>This is the style I was heading for. This is bliss, peace of mind. It probably didn't even take a second to load all of that onto the screen!</p>
    <p>Websites should be following this ideology:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Be simple, but good looking.</li>
        <li>Be small, but serve a purpose.</li>
        <li>Be bold, but know your place.</li>
        <li>And don't be afraid to experiment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All websites nowadays follow a specific pattern and JS can be found pretty much everywhere. It's outright stupid and honestly overwhelming.</p>
    <p>I'll quote the no-css club (which you should totally join!) on this one:
        <blockquote>The modern web is literally Satan and will probably eat your first-born child if we don't do anything about it, and quick!
            To do what the Web was initally intended for (that is, make information accessible via the Internet), all you need is to serve HTML documents. If you need "style" that just means you're trying to cover up your lack of interesting information.</blockquote></p>
    <p>Those couple lines said it way better than I ever could. Remember this mantra when you're designing your website. Keep it simple, stupid!</p>
