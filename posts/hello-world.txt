
hi, welcome to my first text-based blog post.
i've decided against html to conserve space and
because i do not have tools like jekyll to
assist me (i'm generally lazy.)
-----
+why?
i want to. if you're not interested in listening
to ramblings of a nerd on the internet, you're
welcome to leave the page.
but if generally, because i'm forgetful and can
refer to these in the future, like a time capsule.
- well why not use [...]?
because as i stated, i'm too lazy to set up any
static site builders, so i'll do just as fine
with a keyboard and spare time.
-----
+when?
whenever. these will not in any way be in a timely
manner. i will write down stuff when i want/need to,
or whenever a lightbulb comically appears above my head.
(around 2-3 days between a post usually.)
---
+how?
with a keyboard and a text editor. what's nice is
i can fire up nvim, write down a quick post and push
the post. no hassle, no building, no bloat. just text.
