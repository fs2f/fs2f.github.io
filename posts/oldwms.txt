
old window managers are often overlooked, which is
a real shame. most of them might not look appealing out
of the box, which is most likely the reason you've never
tried using them. today i'll talk about my experiences with
twm and evilwm, which i've used for a bit now and admittedly, they
have suited my needs more than any other window manager i've tried.

+twm
quoting wikipedia, tab window manager is a window manager developed
for x11. being started in 1987 by tom lastrange, (as a replacement
for uwm) it has been the standard window manager for x11, since vR4.
the name was originally tom's window manager.
twm is a floating window manager which features stuff that most floating
window managers have: a titlebar, border and some titlebar buttons. a very
interesting feature that twm has is the icon manager. it's a list of windows
running right now, which is something you wouldn't find in a window manager nowadays.
it's very nice if you want to know what windows you have iconified, for example.
twm has a very popular fork named ctwm (for claude's tab window manager). it supports
workspaces, 3d window decorations and much more.
twm does not come with a config file on most systems, as such, i had to read through
the manpages and steal some code from other dotfiles.
twm has a lot of tricks up its sleeve, like the option to completely remove the window decor,
change the fonts, the icons on the titlebar, a very extensive keybinding system and a lot more.
twm's config file is usually formatted like this:
======
SomeOptions

Color {
    SomeColorOption "SomeColorValue"
}
SomeMouseButton = : SomePlace (usually any) : SomeFunction
menu "SomeMenu" {
    SomeTitle f.title
    SomeLabel f.exec SomeProgram
    SomeLabel2 f.restart
    SomeLabel3 f.quit
}
======
this might look a bit confusing at first, but the more you read it, the more understandable
it becomes.
i've found a few nice places to look at .twmrcs, like alpraz's dotfiles and diws1's dotfiles
(the second has a few showcase videos.)
a nice program to have installed alongside twm is vdesk, which emulates workspaces for window
managers that don't have them. if you want to actually have the proper workspace experience,
place the following lines at the start of your config:
======
IconifyByUnmapping
NoIconManagers
======
the following first remove the visual icons from the desktop (vdesk iconifies windows to emulate
the workspace feel) and the second doesn't allow drawing icon managers (again, because it will show
the iconified windows, which ruins the feel).
now let's take a look at a more feature-full window manager.
-----
+evilwm
evilwm is a minimalist window manager released circa 1996. it's a very simple floating windoww manager
that has been forked a couple times, the most notable example being openbsd's calm window manager.
evilwm is minimalist in the way that it omits most things that you usually don't need from a window manager.
if you want a titlebar, icons, shadows, rounding, etc, this wm is not for you. if that's not your case, let's carry on.
icewm is controlled either through the flags given to it at startup or through a file called .evilwmrc,
where you give it the same flags but without the dashes. here's an example of how this works:

======
evilwm -bg "black" -fg "red" -fc "yellow"
======

will have the same effect as this .evilwmrc:

======
bg black
fg red
fc yellow
======

you get the point? good. the manpages are too, a great source of knowledge. my .evilwmrc looks like this (annotated
for your viewing pleasure):

======
term urxvt      # default terminal program to spawn
fn terminus     # for some reason this is broken right now
fg #c2cc66      # focused border color
fc #bc8c4d      # fixed border color (fixed = sticky, shows up on all workspaces)
bg #384137      # unfocused border color
bw 6            # border width
snap 5          # distance from which windows will snap to or from a surface
mask1 alt       # default keybinding mask, i'm used to it
numvdesks 5     # number of workspaces that i can switch to

bind mask1+x=delete     # bind for closing windows
bind mask1+t=spawn      # remember that term thing we defined? this keybind will spawn that
bind mask1+f=resize,toggle+v+h      # fully maximizes a window (not respecting borders)
bind mask1+l=fix,toggle             # had to bind this to l instead. makes a window fixed (sticky)
======

so, to conclude evilwm: it's very small, very simple and very easy. i set it up in ~10 minutes, not
including creating the actual colorscheme/finding a wallpaper to match. evilwm is very nice if you think
twm is too much, and vice versa.
