
i recently got my hands on a minipc which
i plan to use either for kodi or for
hosting an mpd server.
self hosting any service has its own pros
and cons, so let's go over them right now.
if you're asking yourself, "is it worth it
to setup one right now?", this writeup might
help you.
-----
+pros
privacy! you don't need to give out your
data to someone somewhere on the internet.
if you are really paranoid about using a
3rd party web hosting service, this will
be a great perk for you.
+versatility! you can do anything with
this machine, as long as it's legal. you
can set up a NAS, use it for storage or
as a separate computer! you can even turn
it into an irc bouncer if you wish.
+easy access/control! the pc will most
likely stay in your home. if something
happens, you can just walk up to it and
start maintenance right away. pretty neat!
-----
+cons
costs! unless you've got money to burn. these
eat up quite a bit of electricity if you don't
shut them down when they're not used. beware!
quality! it's obviously not gonna be the same
as a service like a2. i mean, c'mon, it's a
mini pc, not a rack. it's not designed to be
powerful.
+time! which you will lose a lot of. these are
usually hard to maintain, but easy if you have
a proper manual.
-----
it really does depend what you're trying to do
with said pc, but this is a heads up for those
who are trying to selfhost a service from scratch.
