        <h2>Hello World (again)</h2>
        <p>Hi, and welcome to my first post written in HTML! This time it won't be as long, but it should serve as a nice introduction if you didn't read the previous ones ;)</p>
        <p>I go online by a number of aliases, most used one to date so far being 'seo'. I've started tampering with tech before I started kindergarten and always have enjoyed experimenting with it.</p>
        <p>This blog will serve as a number of things:</p>
            <ul>A notebook of sorts;</ul>
            <ul>A place for me to ramble about something;</ul>
            <ul>And a place to possibly share some of my configs.</ul>
            <p>That does it for now. Have a nice rest of day.</p>
