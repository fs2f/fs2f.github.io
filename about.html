        <h3>Who am I?</h3>
        <p>I'm fs2f. I'm a teenager with an interest in photography and programming.</p>
        <h3>What do I use?</h3>
        <p>A pair of HP laptops and coffee. Currently, I'm running Fedora 40 and some light software. Nothing crazy, but enough to let me do what I want on my computer.
            I also constantly switch between window managers. The last one I've used so far was evilwm.
        </p>
        <h3>What music do I listen to?</h3>
        <p>A mix of shoegaze, hyperpop, midwest emo and other random genres. I also listen to classical music sometimes. Contrasting, I know.</p>

        <p>Alright, that was enough. You should get back to doing something more productive than reading this now ;)</p>
