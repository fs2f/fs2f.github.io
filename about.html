    <p>Hi, my name's fs2f and this is my personal site.</p>
    <p>I don't have much to say about myself other than I'm a Linux user and sysadmin.
        I try to focus on a thing or two but always lose interest after a while, that's my toxic trait.</p>
    <p>I really like flowers, colors, photography, programming, minimalism and shoegaze.</p>
    <p>I should also note that I am indecisive from time to time, which is why this page has been remade atleast 12 times.</p>
