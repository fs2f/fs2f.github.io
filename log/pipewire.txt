# how to setup pipewire on void linux
------
if moving from pulseaudio, remove it.

fetch pipewire:
[ # xbps-install pipewire elogind ]

symlink elogind's folder to /var/service:
[ # ln -s /etc/sv/elogind /var/service ]

reboot, then bring up elogind:
[ # sv up elogind ]
** make sure XDG_RUNTIME_DIR is exported.

symlink wireplumber's config:
[ # mkdir -p /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d 
  # ln -s /usr/share/examples/wireplumber/10-wireplumber.conf /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d ]

additionally, symlink the pulseaudio compat config:
[ # ln -s /usr/share/examples/wireplumber/20-pipewire-pulse.conf /etc/pipewire/pipewire.conf.d ]

make sure that pipewire can be ran from terminal:
[ # pipewire ] ** if no errors are reported and
pipewire doesn't crash, proceed.

in your environment's autostart file (e.g. xinitrc):
[ pipewire && wireplumber & ]

reboot and test to see if sound is present. if not,
try to troubleshoot. hope this helped!
