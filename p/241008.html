        <p>Heya! You've landed at my first post. I won't be going into much detail here, this is a place where I will be sharing
            a huge lot of rambles.</p>
        <p>Some will be code-related, some will be random things, some will be pieces of code. You'll have to see for yourself.</p>
        <p>That's it for now. Have a nice day!</p>
