            <p>i'm the <del>guy</del> idiot behind this website! there's not much to be said about me, really. i like cats, music, Linux, coffee, flowers, all that stuff.</p>
            <p>i don't really <i>know</i> what i'm doing, but i have a slight understanding of what's going on. i think that's enough.</p>
            <p>i'm pretty fluent in <abbr title="although i don't really think they're 'languages'">HTML/CSS</abbr> if that matters, so you can ask me some stuff about it. just don't do it when i'm running on 3 hours of sleep. trust me.</p>
